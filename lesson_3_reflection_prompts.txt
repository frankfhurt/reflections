When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	To share the project with some teammates or just to have a backup.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	because sometimes you are just making a local test and you don't really want to update the remote



Comands:

git push		| pushes the local commits to the remote repository
git pull		| gets the latest state of the remote repository
git remote		| show the remotes
git remote -v	| show the remotes and their URLs
