When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	To share the project with some teammates or just to have a backup.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because sometimes you are just making a local test and you don't really want to update the remote.
	Or we want to finish the work before push

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is a GitHub tool that clones a repository from a user to another.
	Clone is used when we want to copy some remote repository to our local.
	Branch is used when we want to stop commiting in some branch and start to commit in another one.
	This is very helpful when we want to performe bug fixes, features or just to make some tests without changing
	a master branch.
	

Comands:

git push		| pushes the local commits to the remote repository
git pull		| gets the latest state of the remote repository
git remote		| show the remotes
git remote -v	| show the remotes and their URLs
git fetch		| update just the local copy of the remote branch from the remote
