How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because it points the differences, so you can see easily what is wrong

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    It gets easy to maintain the alterations

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    With the git commit way, we have far more control about what is going to be saved
	then an automatically way.
	And more then that, we can split our commits in a logical way, what the auto way does not do.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because, sometimes, the auterations of this files are related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use them to check how many lines were added and how many were deleted

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because we can rollback the change

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I don't no, yet.
